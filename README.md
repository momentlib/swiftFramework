Swift Framework for Natural Language Date Parsing

This takes the library that was created from [Core](https://github.com/momentlib/core) and turns it into a framework.


**To Use this Framework**

1. Clone this repo
2. Add the framework to your workspace
3. Use the NSDate extension to get back an NSDate object from a natural language string. ex. NSDate.dateFromNaturalLanguage("2 days from now")
